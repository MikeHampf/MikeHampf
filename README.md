## Hi, Iâ€™m @MikeHampf
  - Iâ€™m interested in switching jobs and industries.
  - Iâ€™m currently learning full stack development at Code Platoon.
  - Iâ€™m not currently looking to collaborate on anything at the moment.

## Here's a link to view some of my microphone builds:

## Observations:  
  - Pianos are also dictionaries..
  - Pizza is an open-faced sandwich.
  - Morning cereal with milk is also soup.
     
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... more to come.
